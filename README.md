# Onja Javascript Project 1 : Imagine a quote generator

This is a nice test, not only that but I call it identifier because I know my weakness from doing it.

It is tough for me but I did my best as I could and its toughness requires that I need to work on it. I need to learn more because I hardly had anything to write.

## About the test

It is really clear and I tried to read it many times. For my underestanding, there it is my work on the js quoate. Inside of the js quote, there are some comments of what I have done.
